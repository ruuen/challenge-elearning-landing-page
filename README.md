## What I learned

This challenge was completed almost a year ago, so I am quite happy with the work after taking a break to work on backend learning.

The asset provided for the mobile hero image had extra whitespace at the bottom and clipping of the box shadows which did not look great. The tablet image also had a similar problem with the skewed rectangle being larger than required which made styling it in a responsive manner hard without small hacks.

As a result I decided to re-export the assets from Figma & build the text elements with CSS, and I think this turned out really well.
